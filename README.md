Contribute data on wallets that haven't been added to walletbeat yet or update existing data. Simply adjust the [data.ts](https://github.com/fluidkey/walletbeat/blob/main/src/data/data.ts) file and create a pull request. Pull requests that include screenshots confirming the existence / non-existence of a feature will be merged faster.

Suggestions of additional features to benchmark are also welcome. All features benchmarked should ideally be booleans (i.e. is available / not available) for maintainability.
